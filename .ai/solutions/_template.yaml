# Solution Capture Template
#
# Purpose: Document solutions to problems at resolution time for future searchability
# Filename Convention: YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.yaml
# Usage: When you solve a non-trivial problem, capture it here
#
# How to Use:
# 1. Copy this template to a new file with date prefix
# 2. Fill in all sections
# 3. Add searchable tags (error-type, component, pattern, etc.)
# 4. Link to related solutions if applicable
#
# Benefits:
# - grep solutions/ directory for error messages or symptoms
# - Find previously solved similar problems instantly
# - Build institutional knowledge of problem-solving patterns
# - Avoid solving the same problem twice

# Brief problem statement (1-2 sentences)
problem: |
  [What was the issue? Be specific enough for future grep searches]
  [Include error messages or symptoms if applicable]

# Context that triggered investigation
context: |
  [What were you doing when this happened?]
  [What changed recently?]
  [What was the expected vs actual behavior?]

# What worked to resolve it
solution: |
  [What fixed the problem?]
  [Step-by-step if the solution is non-obvious]
  [Include commands, code changes, or configuration changes]
  [Explain WHY this worked, not just WHAT you did]

# Searchable tags for future lookup
tags:
  - error-type      # e.g., "build-error", "runtime-error", "integration-error"
  - component       # e.g., "authentication", "database", "api-client"
  - pattern         # e.g., "race-condition", "config-issue", "dependency-mismatch"
  # Add custom tags as needed

# Links to related solutions or ADRs
related:
  solutions: []     # e.g., ["2026-01-15-similar-auth-issue.yaml"]
  decisions: []     # e.g., ["001-use-service-pattern.md"]
  references: []    # e.g., ["https://github.com/project/issues/123"]

# Metadata
captured_date: YYYY-MM-DD
captured_by: [name or "automated"]

# Optional: If this led to a pattern, note it here
pattern_extracted: false  # Set to true if added to PATTERNS.md
pattern_reference: null   # e.g., "patterns/API.md#error-handling"

# Example Solution Capture

# problem: |
#   npm build failing with "Cannot find module '@types/node'" after upgrading TypeScript to v5.0
#
# context: |
#   Upgraded TypeScript from 4.9 to 5.0 in package.json
#   Build worked fine before upgrade
#   Error occurred during type checking phase
#
# solution: |
#   TypeScript 5.0 requires explicit @types/node installation, whereas 4.9 included it implicitly
#
#   Fix:
#   npm install --save-dev @types/node
#
#   Why this works: TS 5.0 changed how it resolves type definitions, requiring
#   explicit declaration of Node.js types in package.json
#
# tags:
#   - build-error
#   - typescript
#   - dependency-mismatch
#   - node-types
