# AI-Optimized Task Execution Rules

*Memory-driven implementation workflow for pattern-perfect code execution*

## üö® CRITICAL: NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED

**WARNING TO AI**: You are getting smarter, but that does NOT mean you should skip these rules.

**Common "smart" shortcuts that are FORBIDDEN:**
‚ùå "I don't need to read PATTERNS.md, I know the pattern"
‚ùå "I can figure out the file path without checking FILES.json"
‚ùå "This is simple, I'll skip the build verification"
‚ùå "I'll update all memory files at once at the end"
‚ùå "I know how to handle this, I don't need the template"

**The CORRECT approach:**
‚úÖ ALWAYS read memory files BEFORE any implementation
‚úÖ ALWAYS use templates from PATTERNS.md exactly
‚úÖ ALWAYS verify build after significant changes
‚úÖ ALWAYS mark subtasks [x] immediately after completion
‚úÖ ALWAYS update memory files as specified in rules

**Why these rules exist:**
- Prevent architectural drift
- Ensure pattern consistency
- Maintain code quality
- Enable effective collaboration
- Preserve project knowledge

**Rule**: If you find yourself thinking "I can skip this step because...", STOP. Follow the rule.

## Core Philosophy

Execute tasks with **architectural precision** using the AI memory system for instant pattern application, dependency resolution, and quality assurance. Every implementation follows established patterns with zero architectural drift.

## Pre-Execution Memory Preparation

### 1. **Task Analysis with Memory Context**
```bash
# Required memory consultation before ANY task execution
1. Read task file ‚Üí Understand scope and dependencies
2. Read ARCHITECTURE.json ‚Üí Verify integration approach
3. Read FILES.json ‚Üí Confirm target files and line references
4. Read PATTERNS.md ‚Üí Load implementation templates
5. Read BUSINESS.json ‚Üí Check performance and feature constraints
6. Read QUICK.md ‚Üí Get build commands and debugging approaches
```

### 2. **Pattern-Specific Setup**
```markdown
**For Business Logic Tasks**: Load [PRIMARY_PATTERN] template from PATTERNS.md # e.g., "Service pattern", "Manager pattern"
**For Integration Tasks**: Load [INTEGRATION_PATTERN] template from PATTERNS.md # e.g., "API integration pattern", "Middleware pattern"
**For UI Tasks**: Load [UI_PATTERN] template from PATTERNS.md # e.g., "MVVM", "Component pattern"
**For Repository Tasks**: Load Repository pattern template from PATTERNS.md
**For Caching Tasks**: Load [CACHING_PATTERN] template from PATTERNS.md # e.g., "Cache service pattern"
```

## AI-Optimized Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Memory-Informed Analysis
```
1. **Task Scope Analysis**: Map parent task to architectural layer
2. **Dependency Resolution**: Check FILES.json for all file relationships
3. **Pattern Selection**: Select templates from PATTERNS.md
4. **Integration Planning**: Verify approach against ARCHITECTURE.json
5. **Performance Planning**: Check targets against BUSINESS.json
```

### Phase 2: Pattern-Perfect Implementation
```
1. **Template Application**: Copy relevant pattern from PATTERNS.md
2. **File Targeting**: Use exact file paths from FILES.json
3. **Integration Points**: Follow ARCHITECTURE.json relationships
4. **Quality Gates**: Apply established patterns throughout
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Track against BUSINESS.json targets
```

### Phase 3: Memory-Driven Verification
```
1. **Pattern Compliance**: Verify against PATTERNS.md checklist
2. **Integration Testing**: Confirm ARCHITECTURE.json relationships work
3. **Performance Validation**: Check BUSINESS.json target achievement
4. **Build Verification**: Use commands from QUICK.md - MANDATORY ([BUILD_COMMAND])
5. **Task Completion**: Mark parent task [x] only after ALL subtasks [x] and build succeeds
6. **Memory Update**: Document new patterns discovered
```

## Task Execution Framework

### Complexity-Aware Processing
**Based on memory system complexity calibration:**

**1-2/5 (Simple-Standard)**: Direct implementation with pattern templates
**3/5 (Moderate)**: Template + integration analysis + testing
**4-5/5 (Complex-System)**: Full memory consultation + pattern extension

### Memory-Enhanced Task Processing

#### 1.0 Parent Task Initialization
```markdown
**Memory Loading Phase**:
- [ ] Load pattern template from PATTERNS.md
- [ ] Identify target files from FILES.json with line numbers
- [ ] Verify integration approach with ARCHITECTURE.json
- [ ] Check performance targets from BUSINESS.json
- [ ] Load development commands from QUICK.md

**Pattern Context**: [Specific pattern from PATTERNS.md]
**Integration Points**: [Connections from ARCHITECTURE.json]
**File Scope**: [Files from FILES.json with line references]
```

#### 1.X Subtask Execution (Memory-Driven)
```markdown
- [ ] 1.1 - complexity [X]/5 - [Task description]
  **Memory-Enhanced Implementation**:
  - **File**: [Exact file from FILES.json:line]
  - **Pattern**: [Template from PATTERNS.md]
  - **Template**:
    ```[language]
    // Copy-paste template from PATTERNS.md
    [DEPENDENCY_INJECTION_DECORATOR] # e.g., "@Injectable()", "@Singleton", etc.
    class [FeatureName][Component] [implements/extends] [Interface] {
        constructor(
            // Dependencies from ARCHITECTURE.json
        ) {}
        // Implementation following established pattern
    }
    ```
  - **Integration**: [Specific approach from ARCHITECTURE.json]
  - **Testing**: [Test pattern from existing tests]
  - **Performance**: [Impact on BUSINESS.json targets]
  - **Verification**: [Pattern compliance checklist from PATTERNS.md]

  **CRITICAL**: Mark subtask `[x]` IMMEDIATELY after completing implementation
  **INTERRUPTION RECOVERY**: If interrupted, task progress preserved for recovery
```

```

## Build and Verification Workflow

### Memory-Enhanced Build Process
```bash
# Commands from QUICK.md - Project specific
[BUILD_COMMAND]              # e.g., "./gradlew build", "npm run build", "cargo build"
[TEST_COMMAND]               # e.g., "./gradlew test", "npm test", "cargo test"
[INTEGRATION_TEST_COMMAND]   # e.g., "./gradlew integrationTest", "npm run test:e2e"

# Performance monitoring (from QUICK.md)
# [Project-specific monitoring commands]

# Memory system validation
# Check that implementation follows patterns correctly
```

### Build Verification Frequency (MANDATORY)

**When to Build:**
‚úÖ **After completing each parent task** (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc.)
‚úÖ **Before marking parent task complete**
‚úÖ **After any business logic/service/repository changes**
‚úÖ **After any manifest or configuration changes**
‚úÖ **After any dependency changes**
‚úÖ **After any resource file changes** (assets, configs, etc.)

**When NOT to build (optional):**
‚ö†Ô∏è After individual subtasks within parent (optional but recommended)
‚ö†Ô∏è After test file changes (optional but recommended)
‚ö†Ô∏è After comment-only changes (optional)

**Build Failure Protocol:**
1. **DO NOT** mark task complete if build fails
2. **DO NOT** skip to next task if build fails
3. **DO** fix the build error immediately
4. **DO** document the fix in implementation notes
5. **DO** verify fix with successful build before continuing

**Build Success Verification:**
- Look for "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" or equivalent in output
- Note build time for performance tracking
- If first build after major changes, also test application launch

### Testing Verification Requirements

**Unit Testing (When Required):**
- [ ] New business logic methods: Unit test with mock dependencies
- [ ] New repository methods: Unit test with mocked data layer
- [ ] New business logic: Unit test with edge cases
- [ ] Run tests: Verify all unit tests pass

**Integration Testing (When Required):**
- [ ] Database integration: Integration test with actual database
- [ ] API integration: Integration test with actual API (or mocked)

**Manual Testing (Always Required):**
- [ ] Launch application: Deploy to target environment
- [ ] Test feature: Execute feature workflow end-to-end
- [ ] Test edge cases: Try invalid inputs, error scenarios
- [ ] Test performance: Feature meets performance targets

**Testing Documentation:**
